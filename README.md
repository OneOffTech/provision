# Provision

This repository holds a sharable and "all configuration described in code"
**provision and deployment system** around [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
It relies on a simple and encrypted [KeePass](https://keepass.info) storage file
to manage the passwords of deployed machines.

## Requirements

However, in order to use this setup, none of the mentioned programs are a
requirement, as it runs inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and
well defined through [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Just
make sure you have those two installed.

## Configuration

Before you start, all essential things for Ansible need to be placed into the
`data` directory. Please add:

* `data`/`ansible.hosts` - A typical [Ansible
  inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)
  listing your machines, their IP addresses and SSH ports.
* `data`/`group_vars` - Directory containing [Group specific
  variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)
  for the deployment.
  * `data`/`host_vars` - Directory containing [Host specific
  variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)
  for the deployment.
* `data`/`playbooks` - One or more [Ansible
  playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html)
  to be available.
* `data`/`roles` - The [Ansible
  roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html),
  which are available (if managing with git, they can be perfectly included as
  _[submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)_).
* `data`/`ssh`/`id_rsa` - The private key of a ssh key pair to connect to
  machines.
* `data`/`ssh`/`id_rsa.pub` - The public key of a ssh key pair to connect to
  machines.
* `data`/`passwords.kdbx` - A [KeePass](https://keepass.info) database file,
  holding the passwords of the users on the deployed machines.

> repository](https://github.com/OneOffTech/provision-data-example) to get a

You may want to put and manage all this private (!) data in a git repository,
with obviously very restricted access to it (as it contains important keys). A
git repository can be included nicely - as a
_[submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)_:

* `git submodule add https://github.com/OneOffTech/provision-data-example data`

> the (private) data repository, and the roles inside this, again coming from
> different (probably public) sources.

## Server deployment

Deployment happens through a docker container which runs ansible.

* Apply everything to all: `docker-compose run --rm ansible_commander -i
  ansible.hosts playbooks/install.yml`
* Apply everything to one server: `docker-compose run --rm ansible_commander -i
  ansible.hosts -l YOURSERVER playbooks/install.yml`

## Local deployment

For local deployment,  the setup can not be deployed from a Docker container.
Instead, Ansible must be installed:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c 127.0.0.1 data/playbooks/install.yml
```

## Local Installation

### Prerequesites

* Install [Debian](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/).
  * If encryption is needed, create a LUKS encrypted LVM partition and
    mount it on `/data`.
  * Only install `Standard system utilities` and `SSH server` tasks.
* Allow root (administrator) logins (use keypairs or a strong password).
* Don't create an normal user account, this will be done by the playbooks.
* Register a domain name and point it to your server's public IP address.
* If your server is behind a NAT gateway, setup port forwards on your
  router. How to do so depends on your router model, please consult the
  manufacturers documentation.

At least the following ports will need to be forwarded (may be changed in
configuration):

```
    OpenSSH server: TCP 54646
    Web services:   TCP 80 + TCP 443
    OpenVPN server: TCP 1194 + UDP 1194
```

### On administrating machine

To manage hosts with [ansible](http://ansible.com/) you need to install
`ansible` on your machine:

```debian
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install ansible pykeepass passlib
```

### Only run certain roles

To save time, you can tell ansible to only run certain playbooks by
supplying the `--tags` flag, which can use multiple parameters. A
simple example would be `--tags="kbox,vpn"`. To see a list of defined tags,
you can check the site.yml.

### Check for changed configuration

To see the differences between the server and the configured playbooks, add
the `--check` flag. To highlight the current state and proposed changes,
additionally use the `--diff` flag.

For configuration of the individual roles, please check out the respective
`README.md` files in the `roles/` directory.

## Notes

### Default locations

Per default settings, all data will belong to "user", which has root
privilege via `sudo`, as well as permissions to use `docker`.

The docker-compose files will be located in `/home/user/deploy`, and the
persistent data will be located in `/data`, which is optionally an encrypted
partition that does not get mounted automatically on reboot.

### Encrypted Data partitions

If `/data` is located on an encrypted partition, the administrator will need
to log into the server after each reboot and mount the volume manually by
running:

```debian
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vg01/data-crypt data-decrypt
# [enter password]
mount /dev/mapper/data-decrypt /data/
```
